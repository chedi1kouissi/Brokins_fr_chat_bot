# 🧠 Brokins Insurance Chatbot

A production-ready, AI-powered chatbot built to assist users with insurance-related questions based on official documents and website content from **Brokins.fr** and its insurance partners (Cardif, APRIL, AFI ESCA, Generali, etc.).

This project uses a **modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture with **Google Gemini models** to provide accurate, document-grounded responses.

## 🧠 Architecture

**Multi-Expert RAG Pipeline**
1. PDF is chunked into semantically meaningful sections.
2. Each Gemini submodel reads a different chunk range (e.g., 5–10 pages).
3. Relevant responses are collected and passed to a final model.
4. Final model generates a professional, document-grounded answer.

**Model Configuration:**
- Submodels: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Final model: `gemini-2.0-flash` (or upgraded if available)
- Token limit handling and fallback logic included
